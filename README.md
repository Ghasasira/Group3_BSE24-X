# Netflix Clone

A Netflix clone built with Node.js and React to simulate key functionalities of the popular video streaming platform. This project demonstrates proficiency in building scalable full-stack applications, utilizing RESTful APIs, and managing user authentication.

# Technologies Used

Frontend: React, React Router, Redux (for state management), CSS (or styled-components)
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB (or another database of your choice)
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
API: TMDb API (for fetching movie data)

# Server

Inside of project directory we made 2 directories: netflix_ui (frontend) and netflix-api(backend). It's important to know because there is script that starts both and it's using such path.

For server we used Node.js:

```commandline
npm install
```

```
npm run start
```

## Frontend

For frontend we used React.js:

```commandline
npm install
```

```
npm run start
```
